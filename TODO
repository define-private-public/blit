TODO:
-----
 * Resize Tool


Next TODO Goals:
----------------
 * TextCel for the Text tool
 * BrushTool (it's a bit of a time sink, do it later)
 * OpenGL rendering (use a hardware renderer instead of software)
 * Timeline Widget overhaul
   - remove as much dependancy on BlitApp
   - Tick -> TimedFrameItem


Next Next TODO Goals:
---------------------
 * HSV/HSL sliders Color choosers
 * Camera capture
 * New version checking feature upon startup, make sure it doesn't make a fuss
   about a bad connection.  Couple this with a notification area or popup.
 * For Tools, make sure that there is a list of "supported versions," so that
   there aren't any incompatability issues
 * Research Qt's Undo Framework
 * Skip Qt's built in Toolbar, make our own.
 * Work on thumb timeline
   - In fact, might also want to fixup regualr Timeline/Tick relationship
 * Use DockWidgets (if it works for other platforms)
 * CIELab Color chooser
   - Don't forget radio CIELab
 * Timeline controls
   -  E.g., buttons to swap between frames
 * better controls for moving frames and adjusting holds (i.e. no spinner)
   - Also maybe allow blank spots in the XSheet
   - Allow the user to "stretch," frames
   - Left click menu on Timeline widget
 * Ticks will display info in a Tooltip on hover
   - Or in another window called "Frame Info"
   - Get rid of the "curSelected," static, the Tick should be stateless
     - It's a real obsticle to progress
	 - Maybe the Timeline widget should handle this
   - Ticks as have a pointer to the Timeline widget itself (it's parent)
   - Ticks are a visualization of FrameRef
 * Move the Color Palette widget to a QGraphicsView/Scene combo
   - Might be necessary to research proxy widgets
   - Allow for the user to move colors around
     - Not just a grid, maybe free form?
 * Multi planes
 * Modularize BlitApp
 * User can organize swatches
