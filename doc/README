This is where documentation is located for application use stuff and technology
surrounding blit; or at least is should be here.  If you need to read
implementation stuff, check the source code.

Source code documentation can be generated either via Qt's `qdoc` tool or
Doxygen.  The later looks much nicer.

There are few Graphviz files (the ones that end in `.gv`) that visualize the how
some of the classes are used in relation to others.
