Blit File Format Version 1:
---------------------------

Blit will use it own file format for the animations.  There is no extension for
the current version (1).  Everything will be saved into a directroy that is the
name of the project.  Inside the folder, there will be a bunch of 32-Bit PNGs
and one XML file.  The PNGs are the images for the PNGCels.  The XML file
contains all of the informaton regarding the animation sequence.



The Cel class will have the following structure:
 - a type (e.g. "PNG")
 - a name, should be a unique non-empty string
   - TODO add in note if it's dynamically allocated or not
 - Width and Height (cache of the cels's resolution, in pixels).

 There can me many differnt types of Cels (e.g. PNG), each with their own
 underlying implementation.  For example the PNGCel will have an underlying
 32-bit premultiplied PNG with the same name as the name field.

 Example:
 --------
 <cel type="PNG" name="cel-3c5a" width="35" height="80" />
 --------



The CelRef class will have the foloowing strucutre:
 - cel, a non-empty string that points to a Cel's name
 - x & y, integers that contain the placement of the Cel/CelRef inside a Frame

 Example:
 --------
 <staged_cel cel="cel-3c5a" x="5" y="-2" />
 --------



The Frame class has the following structure:
 - Name, a non-empty unique string
 - A list of CelRef objects, they should be in order:
   - CelRef at layer 0 (topmost) should be at the front
   - CelRef at layer N (bottommost) should be at the end

 Example:
 --------
 <frame name="f2">
   <staged_cel cel="glance-1" x="0" y="0" />
  <staged_cel cel="cel-3c5a" x="5" y="-2" />
 </frame>
 --------



The TimedFrame class has the following structure:
 - Frame, a non-empty string that correclates to a Frame object
 - Number, a positive integer that represents the frame number of this TimedFrame
 - Hold, a positive integer that represents how long to hold out this TimedFrame
   for

 Example:
 --------
 <timed_frame frame="f2" number="3" hold="2" />
 --------



The XSheet class has the following structure:
 - FPS, a positive integer for the Frames Per Second this animation should be
   shown at
 - Sequence Length, A Cache of how long the sequence is
 - Plane, a collection of TimedFrames is a plane (currently there is one one)
   - number, an integer that specifies which order the layer is
   - count, a cache of the FrameRef Count

  Example:
  --------
  <xsheet fps="50" seq_length="8">
    <plane number="1" count="2">
      <timed_frame frame="f1" number="1" hold="4" />
      <timed_frame frame="f2" number="5" hold="4" />
    </plane>
  </xsheet>
  --------



The Animation class is the sort of "base structure" for the file format.  It
contains the following fields:
 - Version, an integer that signifies which version this XML file is
 - Name, A string (possibly empty) given to the Animaiton
 - created, a unix timestamp of when the Animation was created
 - updated, a unix timestamp of when the Animation was last changed
 - width & height, positive integers that signify the frame size for the
   animation.
 - cels a list of Cel objects
   - count, a cache of how many Cels there are
 - frames a list of Frame objects
   - count, a cache of how many Frames there are
 - xhseet, The Exposure Sheet object (see above)

  Example:
  --------
  <animation version="2">
    <name>Magical Unicorn Adventure!</name>
    <created format="unix_timestamp">1420309397</created>
    <updated format="unix_timestamp">1420327082</updated>
    <width>800</width>
    <height>480</height>
    <cels count="8">
      ...
    </cels>
    <frames count="8">
      ...
    </frames>
    <xsheet>
      ...
    </xsheet>
  </animation>
  --------



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A file called "palette.xml" contains the color palette of the working Blit File.
It is very simple.  There is a root node called <palette> and an ordered list of
<color> tags, where the color value in stored in the AARRGGBB format (upper case
hex strings).  The version number should be the same as the current Blit File
Format number.  See below for an example.

  Example:
  --------
  <palette version="2">
    <color value="FF000000" />
	<color value="FFFFFFFF" />
    <color value="FFFF0000" />
	<color value="FF00FF00" />
	<color value="FF0000FF" />
	<color value="FF00FFFF" />
	<color value="FFFF00FF" />
	<color value="FFFFFF00" />
  </palette>

If you are confused on how this file format works, it would be best to consult
one of the samples in the `samples/` directory of this project.
