This is a list features that I'd love to add, but shouldn't focus on yet:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * "Regions," e.g. you can select a region of pixels in in multiple frames, and
   give them the same I.D.  If you say, change the colors of one set of pixels,
   it will change them in all of the frames.  Need to see if this feature is
   practical/useful or not.
 * Camera/Pencil test mode.  For my bros at SoFA who can't use FlipBook anymore.
   All it will do is open up a camera (if there is one found) then allow people
   to take pictures.  Maybe add blending like "add," and "multiply?"  Make sure
   this isn't part of the main branch, just a side one that just keeps on
   merging.
 * Hue color palatte shift.  Might be a bit redundant, but select a few differnt
   colors in a palatte and shift their hues together.
 * Scale export.  Scale an image upon export (possibly import too)
 * Custom tool tutorial.  Make this fun.
 * Custom background.  For example, instead of the standard checkerboard for
   transparency, allows for an image, color, or pattern.
 * Wheel color chooser.  Choose colors from a wheel
 * GTK color chooser.  Choose colors like that of GTK's color choosing widget
   - Sort of using this already, but a mean a more compact one w/ out a dialog
 * Different color modes (this is combined with the "master palatte," thing
 * Color scheme picker (i.e. analogous)
 * Hot-Keys:
   - E.g. : "?" brings up hotkeys.
 * When adding a new frame, the tick will fade from a color
 * Advanced Color Management (e.g. ICC profiles)
