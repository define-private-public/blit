====== Blit Development Wiki ======

===== What is Blit? =====
Blit is the working title for a long and dangerous journey that Benjamin Summerton (Ben) has embarked on.  He has long hungered for a 2D Animation program that he liked, but didn't cost a crap-ton of money.  Blit is his solution to a bitmap based Animation suite.  It is built using C++ & Qt5.

Mainly for anyone who is working on Blit to jot down notes about how things work.  I.e. what module is supposed to do what (and what it shouldn't do).
