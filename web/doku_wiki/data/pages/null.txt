====== Null ======

The concept of a "Null object," is not the same as a NULL pointer to an object.  This is used in the case that we need a physical object to work with, but can't consider it "full," yet.  Many objects such as [[animation:cel|Cel]] and [[animation:xsheet|XSheet]] have certain quantifiers that determine if the object is Null or not.

This construct is borrowed from Qt, where some of their classes (such as QImage), even though instatiated are considered Null.
