====== Cel Widget ======

The CelWidget is a simple widget that is used within the [[widgets:celswindow|Cels Window]] to visualize, modify, and sort [[animation:cel|Cels]] within a [[animation:frame|Frame]].

  * It is stateless
  * It is a subclass of QGraphicsObject
  * It shows a preview of the Cel
  * It shows the name of the Cel
  * It shows the resolution of the Cel
  * It will emit a signal when it the clicked
    * This signal will tell the [[widgets:celswindow|Cels window]] to make this CelWidget's [[animation:cel|Cel]] the current one

===== TODO =====
There a still a few things left undone:
  * Need to add a "Delte Cel," button
  * Need to add a "Reisze Cel," button
  * Need to add a spinner/slider to adjust Cel opacity
