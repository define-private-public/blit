====== Cel ======

A single paintable layer.

  * It is a sublcass of  QGraphicsObject
  * It is a stateful class that depends on [[:blitapp|BlitApp]]'s current project location
    * This is set though in the constructor when the Cel is first created, and is presistance throughout the life of the Cel
    * So it's less stateful, but depends on the instantiation of [[:blitapp|BlitApp]]
  * The actual image data is only loaded up when the Cel is marked "active."
  * All Cels are saved to the project location as 32-Bit PNG images.
  * Cels can have an arbitrary size and location in the [[frame|Frame]]
