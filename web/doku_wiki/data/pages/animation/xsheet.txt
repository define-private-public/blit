====== XSheet ======

//Pronounced Exposure Sheet//
 XSheet is a collection of [[frame|Frame]] objects.  It's main job to organize all of the Frame objects in to a coherent animation sequence (i.e. timing and spacing).

  * It is a sublcass of QObject
  * It is stateless
  * Contains data for the animation sequence like "frames per second"
  * An XSheet is considered Null if it doesn't contain any frames
